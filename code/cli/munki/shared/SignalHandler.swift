/// Installs a signal handler and returns an object that controls it;
/// Be sure to activate it!
///
/// Why does this exist?
///
/// When our process is terminated via SIGINT (think Control-C), SIGTERM (think `kill` or `killall`),
/// any subprocesses it has started are _not_ automatically terminated,
/// This could be a problem if the user hits control-C while running `managedsoftwareupdate`, expecting
/// to stop an in-progress install, or while running `munkiimport`, expecting it to stop building a huge disk image
/// containing Xcode. In fact, I'd say the user would most likely expect that any subprocess would also be stopped.
/// While we can't do anything about SIGKILL, we can install handlers for SIGINT and SIGTERM that can find all
/// of the processes that are children of the current process, and send SIGINT or SIGTERM to those processes
/// before exiting this process.
///
/// A complication: some of the tools call libedit's readline function, which seems to do it's own mangling
/// of signal handling, in such a way that if we have these handlers in place, you cannot use SIGINT (again, think
/// Control-C) or SIGTERM to stop the process while it's waiting for input. So we've added a way to kill the
/// libedit/readline "session" as part of these signal handlers by passing a cleanup function to be run.
///
/// Additionally, if the libedit readline function is active when the process receives SIGINT or SIGTERM, the
/// signal handling enters an infinite loop if you try to send the original signal to the original process. So
/// instead of doing that, we just exit.
///
/// One more complication: I find `hdiutil create` doesn't always exit when send a SIGINT or SIGTERM.
/// Still investigating this one, but replicated the behavior in the terminal!
///
/// All of this feels hacky, but it's the best I could come up with. Would love to learn of a better approach!
