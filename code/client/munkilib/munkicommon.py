munkicommon

Created by Greg Neagle on 2008-11-18.

Common functions used by the munki tools.
"""

# this module current exists purely for backwards-compatibity so that anything
# calling munkicommon functions will still work (for now)

# We wildcard-import from submodules for backwards compatibility; functions
# that were previously available from this module
