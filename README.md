Munki
=====

_Managed software installation for macOS_

#### Introduction

Munki is an open source project from [Walt Disney Animation Studios](https://www.disneyanimation.com/open-source/).

Munki is a set of tools that, used together with a webserver-based repository of packages and package metadata, can be used by macOS administrators to manage software installs (and in many cases removals) on macOS client machines.

Munki can install software packaged in the Apple package format, and also supports Adobe CS3/CS4/CS5/CS6/CC deployment packages, and drag-and-drop disk images as installer sources.

Additionally, Munki can be configured to install Apple Software Updates, either from Apple's server, or yours.

Munki is currently in use at organizations all over the world, managing software for tens of thousands of Macs.
